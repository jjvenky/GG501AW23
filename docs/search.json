    "text": "1.1 Course Description\nTranslating data into actionable insights requires more than analytical tools; the ability to communicate, visualize, deconstruct and interrogate analytic results is an increasingly required set of skills for environmental professionals. This course builds the skills and knowledge needed to interpret, critique, and communicate outputs from data-analytic workflows and processes. Key issues discussed include parameterization, sensitivity analysis, visualization, and summarizing results for a variety of audiences."
